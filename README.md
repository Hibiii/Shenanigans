# Shenanigans

A small collection of tiny bits of code for random reasons.

# modbanks.py

A little script I made for switching between banks of mods. It's meant to be used as a pre-launch custom command in MultiMC/PolyMC, and effectively symlinks `/mods` to `/fabricmods` or `/quiltmods`. See the file or run it with the `instructions` argument to get more details. Only Fabric and Quilt are supported for now.

## mineformat.js

A little piece of Javascript that takes some _Minecraft_ (Java) JSON text and formats it to HTML. Work on it is halted.

## ncCounter.js

A NeoCities specific web counter! It uses NeoCities's own API, so it's all in the browser. It's placed in public domain. [More info on ncCounter here.](https://hibi.neocities.org/ncCounter.html)

## switchjava.sh

A small script that you can put in your PATH to switch between JAVA_HOMEs for a specific command. For more information, please read the comments in the file.

## windows xp icons for multimc.zip

An icon set for MultiMC5 with icons from Windows XP, fits well when running the launcher in XP.
