## ARPS

ARPS (or Automatic Rail Point Switching) is an automatic rail point switching. It is currently being implementend, see more details at [my proposal for a rail switching system using ComputerCraft](https://hibiscus.pet/minecraft/cc-rail-switch).

### Installing the switcher

1. Set the computer in a place not further than 64 blocks away from any relevant activator rail.
2. Make the startup folder if you haven't already done so.
3. Copy autoswitch.lua to the startup folder.
4. Edit autoswitch.lua config as needed.
5. Reboot the system to activate the switcher.
